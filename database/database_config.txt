# ABOUT
# This file configures the fields that will be stored in the fits_data table of the seo database.
# This file is read in the create_database.py code, so changing it will only change the fields
# stored in the actual database by rerunning that code, which may entail deleting and repopulating
# the database. This file is also used in StepAddToDatabase, so make sure to recreate the database
# if you change this before running the pipestep.

# FORMAT
# Every non-empty line should consist of words separated only by whitespace:
# the name of the desired sql field and, optionally, the exact specification of the type used
# to store the field using SQL types. If the latter is not given, varchar(15) is assumed.
# Lines starting with hashtags are ignored.
# The first non-empty, non-comment line will be used as the primary key for the table.

# NAMING CONVENTION
# It is good to have a standard convention for SQL table fields storing database
# that corresponds to a FITS header field so that we can convert between the two 
# without exception. I recommend the following convention: 
# decapitalize the field, replace hyphens with underscores, and add a trailing underscore.
# The reasons for these are (1) SQL fields are traditionally lowercase (2) hyphens are not allowed
# in field names (3) some header fields such as "dec" are SQL keywords. Adding an underscore prevents 
# this. The trailing underscore is not mandatory but you should make sure your field name is not an 
# sql keyword if you leave it out.

# Note that the function that adds records to a database for testing purposes in create_databases.py
# assumes that file_path is the primary key (first entry here)
