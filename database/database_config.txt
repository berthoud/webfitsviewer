# ABOUT
# This file configures the tables, table columns, and users created by the create_database.py code.
# Changes will only be brought about by running that file. Changing an already created database
# may entail deleting and repopulating it after running create_database.py -overwrite. 

# This file is also used in StepAddToDatabase, so make sure to recreate the database
# if you change this before running the pipestep.

# FORMAT
# File format is described in database_readme.md

# NAMING CONVENTION
# It is good to have a standard convention for SQL table fields storing database
# that corresponds to a FITS header field so that we can convert between the two easily. 
# I recommend the following convention: 
# decapitalize the field name, replace hyphens with underscores, and add a trailing underscore.
# The reasons for these are (1) SQL fields are traditionally lowercase (2) hyphens are not allowed
# in field names (3) some header fields such as "dec" are SQL keywords. Adding an underscore prevents 
# this. The trailing underscore is not mandatory but you should make sure your field name is not an 
# sql keyword if you leave it out.
